            The university started functioning in November 2002 by taking over two federal government colleges namely Federal Urdu Science College, 
            Karachi which were established in 1949 by Baba-e-Urdu Dr. Abdul Haq. Whose mission was only to promote Urdu as teaching and also for Urdu language as 
            national language. He remains struggling till his last moment of life.
         </p>
